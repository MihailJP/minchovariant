+HZ Socho OpenType font
+======================
 This is a free/libre OpenType CID-keyed Japanese font
 derived from [GlyphWiki](http://en.glyphwiki.org/wiki/GlyphWiki:MainPage)'s
 CJK data, with weight variations.
 
 Latin, Greek and Cyrillic glyphs are not derived from GlyphWiki but from
-[Computer Modern Unicode](http://canopus.iacp.dvo.ru/~panov/cm-unicode/)
+[Sorts Mill Goudy](https://bitbucket.org/sortsmill/sortsmill-fonts)
+(package released under MIT license, not OFL) for Latin alphabet, and
+[Asea](http://users.teilar.gr/~g1951d/) for Greek and Cyrillic,
 because GlyphWiki's [Kage engine](http://fonts.jp/kage/index.en.html) is
 intended for Chinese characters and not good at LGC.
