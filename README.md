HZ Mincho OpenType font
=======================
This is a free/libre OpenType CID-keyed Japanese font
derived from [GlyphWiki](http://en.glyphwiki.org/wiki/GlyphWiki:MainPage)'s
CJK data, with weight variations.

Latin, Greek and Cyrillic glyphs are not derived from GlyphWiki but from
[Computer Modern Unicode](http://canopus.iacp.dvo.ru/~panov/cm-unicode/)
because GlyphWiki's [Kage engine](http://fonts.jp/kage/index.en.html) is
intended for Chinese characters and not good at LGC.

A few symbols, namely CIDs 16314, 16323, 16324 and 16325,
came from [Symbola](http://users.teilar.gr/~g1951d/) font.
